# Virtual-Mouse

Intro
    Using fingertip tracking as a virtual mouse is a popular method of interacting with computers without a mouse device.  In this work, we propose a novel virtual-mouse method using RGB-D images and fingertip detection.The experimental results showed a high accuracy level; the system can work well in real-world environments with a single CPU. This fingertip-gesture-based interface allows humans to easily interact with computers by hand.
    
Packages used:
1,Open cv - OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. 

2,mediapipe - Mediapipe is a cross-platform library developed by Google that provides amazing ready-to-use ML solutions for computer vision tasks.

3,autopy - AutoPy is a simple, cross-platform GUI automation library for Python. It includes functions for controlling the keyboard and mouse, finding colors and bitmaps on-screen, and displaying alerts.

4,Numpy - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

5,Math - Python has a built-in module that you can use for mathematical tasks. The math module has a set of methods and constants.

By using these packages we going to do a virtual mouse project in this project we are going to move our mouse and perform right click through the code using python
in this project we are divided into two modules handtracking module and virtual mouse module in handtracking module we are going to perform hand detection, find position of hands, find disatance of hands and find which fingers are up then we are going to implement our hand tracking module into our virtual mouse module
